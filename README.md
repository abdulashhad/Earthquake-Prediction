# Earthquake-Prediction
This project focuses on earthquake prediction using machine learning and data science techniques based on historical seismic data. The work involves analyzing earthquake-related features such as magnitude, depth, location, and time to identify patterns that may indicate future seismic activity. The pipeline includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation using supervised learning algorithms. Different machine learning models were explored and compared to study their predictive performance and generalization ability. The project demonstrates the application of machine learning for seismic data analysis and highlights the challenges associated with uncertainty, data imbalance, and real-world prediction in geophysical systems.
